# global_covid

These queries look at global covid19 data and use my SQL knowledge to find interesting information about the state of covid19 in the world.
Towards the end of the program, there are a series of queries created to replicate the graphs commonly seen with covid19 i.e. the graphs seen when one types in "us covid cases" on to Google and looks at the New York Times graphs.
